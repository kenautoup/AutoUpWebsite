# Merge "The System" and "Why It Works" Into One Continuous Section

## What to Change

Combine the current "THE SYSTEM" section (headline + subtext + three pillar cards) and the "WHY IT WORKS" section (headline + comparison cards) into a single unified section. Remove the "WHY IT WORKS" section tag and "The Old Playbook Is Toast" headline entirely.

## New Section Structure (top to bottom)

All within ONE section, ONE background, no visual breaks between these elements:

1. **Section tag:** "THE SYSTEM" (cyan uppercase, same as current)

2. **Headline:** "10,000+ Positive Replies." (regular) + "Every Month." (italic cyan accent) — same as current, no change

3. **Subtext:** "Not opens. Not clicks. Positive replies from verified decision-makers — generated by an outbound engine built on proprietary data, reply-optimized copy, and infrastructure that hits primary at scale." — same as current, no change

4. **Comparison cards** — moved UP to sit directly below the subtext, before the pillar cards. Two cards side by side:

   **Left card — "THE OLD WAY"**
   - White background, light border
   - Red/coral X icons for each bullet
   - Bullets:
     - Bought lists from ZoomInfo and Apollo
     - Template emails with merge tags
     - Shared sending infrastructure
     - Flagged as promotional, lands in spam
     - Same prospects your competitors are emailing

   **Right card — "THE AUTOUP SYSTEM"**
   - Dark background (#0c1b2e), subtle cyan border
   - Cyan checkmark icons, white text
   - Bullets:
     - AI-built databases exclusive to each client
     - Every sequence written by strategists who've sent millions of emails
     - Proprietary infrastructure, warmed and scaled in real time
     - Hits primary inbox consistently
     - Fresh contacts your competitors can't access

   Both cards should be equal height, vertically aligned, with consistent padding. Tighten the gap between the subtext and the cards — they should feel connected, not floating.

5. **Three pillar cards** — moved DOWN to sit below the comparison cards. Same content, same layout, same icons as they are now ("Your Data, Not a List" / "Copy That Sounds Human" / "Proprietary Infrastructure"). No changes to these cards.

## What to Remove

- The "WHY IT WORKS" section tag
- The "The Old Playbook Is Toast." headline
- The separate background/section break that existed between the two sections
- Any extra spacing or dividers between the old two sections

## Background

The entire merged section should use ONE consistent background — white (#ffffff) to match the current "THE SYSTEM" section. Do not use the light gray that the old "WHY IT WORKS" section had.

## Key Point

This should feel like one continuous section with a clear visual hierarchy: headline → comparison → pillars. No section breaks, no second headline, no redundant tags. One story, one scroll.
