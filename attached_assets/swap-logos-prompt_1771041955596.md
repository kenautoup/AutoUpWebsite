# Swap In White Logo Files for Case Study Cards

## What to Change

I've uploaded two new logo files: `diverse-logo-white.png` and `reggora-logo-white.png`. These are white logos on transparent backgrounds, ready for use on the dark case study cards.

Replace the current SVG icon approximations (or broken logo images) in the Diverse and Reggora case study cards with these new image files.

## Implementation

- **Diverse card**: Use `diverse-logo-white.png` as an img tag to the left of "Diverse" company name
- **Reggora card**: Use `reggora-logo-white.png` as an img tag to the left of "Reggora" company name
- Height: 32px for both, width: auto
- No CSS filters needed — these are already white with transparent backgrounds, use them as-is
- Remove any existing SVG icons or broken img tags that are currently in the logo position
