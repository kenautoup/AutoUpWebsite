Add a reusable CTA card component to the blog section of this website. Use the existing tech stack and styling conventions already in the project.
Component Name: BlogCTA
Design specs:

Rounded card (border-radius: 16px) with a soft gradient background going from light blue-green on the left to light lavender on the right (approximate colors: #e8f4f8 → #e0dff0)
Subtle drop shadow
All content centered
Max-width ~900px, centered in parent container
Generous internal padding (~60px vertical, ~40px horizontal)

Content top to bottom:

Headline — Large, bold, serif italic font. Two lines:

Line 1: "You Don't Need More Outbound." (dark, near-black)
Line 2: "You Need More " in dark + "Positive Replies." in teal/cyan (#00CED1)


Subtext — Smaller, gray, regular weight: "We've sent 35M+ cold emails last year. Instantly.ai Certified Experts. Clients on all continents. Let's talk about outbound."
Two buttons side by side (stack vertically on mobile):

Primary: "Book Intro Call →" — background #4A5FC1, white text, rounded, links to /book-call
Secondary: "See Client Results" — white background, dark text, subtle border, rounded, links to /case-studies


Social proof row — 5 small circular avatar images overlapping slightly, followed by text "Trusted by 200+ companies"

Where to place it:

Blog listing page: Insert the BlogCTA component between the 3rd and 4th post in the feed. If there are fewer than 4 posts, put it at the end.
Individual blog post pages: Insert the BlogCTA component at the bottom of the article body, after the last paragraph but before any related posts, comments, or footer. Add ~48px vertical margin above and below.

Requirements:

Build it as a single reusable component that gets imported in both locations
Make the headline text, subtext, and button URLs configurable via props with sensible defaults
For the avatars, create 5 placeholder circular images (use colored circles with initials or stock placeholder images if no real avatars are available)
Fully responsive — buttons stack on mobile, font sizes scale down, padding reduces on small screens
Match the font families and general design language already used in this project. For the headline specifically, use a serif italic font — import Playfair Display from Google Fonts if no serif font is already in the project
Do not break any existing pages or layouts
